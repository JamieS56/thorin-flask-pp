He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of  Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to  reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company  as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dain Ironfoot II along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.",

      "description": "Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the Dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger brother of Óin. In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown what significance he did, being 16 years old. In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so  that Smaug wouldn't start an alliance with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned hobbits, Glóin referred them as 'simpletons' and also said that hobbits 'would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell'.",

He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.",

The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.",

      "description": "Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived. Before the Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and Ori. In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain. Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them. Both shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.",

Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.",

His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen 'by some fifty years,' and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was 'the eldest left.' Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.",
